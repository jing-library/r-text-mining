## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. Sentiment Analysis or opinion mining is a text analysis technique that automatically identify and extracts the sentiment tone from within text. The analysis utilizes lexicons to help analyze the content of the other texts. The lexicons have already identified words the emotional tone that then can be compared to in other texts.



The `tidytext` package comes with three sentiment lexicons in the sentiment’s dataset. The lexicons are the sentiment lexicon from [Bing Liu and collaborators]( https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), the [NRC Emotion Lexicon]( http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney, and the lexicon of [Finn Arup Nielsen]( http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/6010-full.html). These lexicons are based on unigrams, i.e., single words from the English language. The `bing` lexicon categorizes words into positive or negative, the `nrc` lexicon categorizes words into emotions anger, sadness, surprise, and joy, and the `AFINN` lexicon categorizes words using a score, with negative scores indicating a negative sentiment.

The function `get_sentiments()` allows us to get specific sentiment lexicons with the appropriate measures for each one. Let's look at how each of the lexicons attributes sentiment to the words. 

```r
library(tidytext)
get_sentiments("bing")
```
```output
#> # A tibble: 6,786 × 2
#>    word        sentiment
#>    <chr>       <chr>    
#>  1 2-faces     negative 
#>  2 abnormal    negative 
#>  3 abolish     negative 
#>  4 abominable  negative 
#>  5 abominably  negative 
#>  6 abominate   negative 
#>  7 abomination negative 
#>  8 abort       negative 
#>  9 aborted     negative 
#> 10 aborts      negative 
#> # … with 6,776 more rows
```

```r
get_sentiments("nrc")
```

```output
#> # A tibble: 13,901 × 2
#>    word        sentiment
#>    <chr>       <chr>    
#>  1 abacus      trust

## Sentiment Analysis with Inner Join

Since we are using tidy data format, sentiment analysis can be done as an inner join. In the same manner with how to remove stop words with antijoin, performing sentiment analysis is an inner join function.

First, we need to take the text of the novels and convert the text to the tidy format using unnest_tokens(), just as we did in the last lesson. Let’s also set up some other columns to keep track of which line and chapter of the book each word comes from; we use group_by and mutate to construct those columns.

```r
library(gutenbergr)
hgwells <- gutenberg_download(c(35, 36, 5230))

tidy_books <- tidy_hgwells() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
         chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]", 
                                                 ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```







Because we name the count column word in unnest_tokens(), it’s convenient to join with the sentiment dataset. 

Let’s look at the words with a joy score from the NRC lexicon. What are the most common joy words in the novel The Time Machine. First, let’s use the NRC lexicon and filter() for the joy words and then use inner_join() to perform the sentiment analysis. Let’s use count() from dplyr. What are the most common joy words in The Time Machine? 



```r
library(gutenbergr)
library(dplyr)

nrc_joy <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "joy")

tidy_time_machine <- time_machine %>% 
   inner_join(nrc-joy) %>%
   count(word, sort = TRUE)
  
tidy_time_machine
```



The tibble that was created found mostly positive words. We can also examine how the positive words change when comparing several books. First, we find a sentiment score for each word using the Bing lexicon and inner_join(). Next, we count up how many positive and negative words there are in defined sections of each book. We define an index here to keep track of where we are in the narrative; this index (using integer division) counts up sections of 80 lines of text.

tidy_hgwells_sentiment <- tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  mutate(index = linenumber %/% 80) %>% 
  count(book, index, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = list(n = 0)) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)



Now let's plot the positive and negative words for the H.G. Wells novels from Project Gutenberg. 

```r
library(ggplot2)


ggplot(tidy_hgwells_sentiment) + 
  geom_col(aes(index, sentiment, fill = book), show.legend = F) + 
  facet_wrap( ~ book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x") 
```






## Most common positive and negative words

By implementing count() here with arguments of both word and sentiment, we find out how much each word contributed to each sentiment.
 
 
```r 
bing_word_counts <- tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
```




The word “miss” is coded as negative but if it is used as a title for young, unmarried women in novels, it is not necessarily negative. If it were appropriate for our purposes, we could easily add “miss” to a custom stop-words list using bind_rows(). We could implement that with a strategy such as this：

```r 
custom_stop_words <- tibble(word = c("miss"), lexicon = c("custom")) %>% 
  bind_rows(stop_words)
  
  
  bing_word_counts <- tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = T) %>% 
  ungroup()
```



































This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.txt) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Figures

You can also include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

Or you can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use general purpose lexicons
- Use sentiments dataset
