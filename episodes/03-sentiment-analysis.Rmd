## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. Sentiment Analysis or opinion mining is a text analysis technique that automatically identify and extracts the sentiment tone from within text. The analysis utlizes lexicons to help analysize the content of the other texts. The lexicons have already identfied words the emotional tone that then can be compared to in other texts.

The tidytext package comes with three sentiment lexicons in the sentiments dataset. The lexicons are the sentiment lexicon from Bing Liu and collaborators, the NRC Emotion Lexicon from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney, and the lexicon of Finn Arup Nielsen. These lexicons are based on unigrams, i.e., single words from the English language. The bing lexicon categorizes words into positive or negative; the nrc lexicon categorizes words into emotions like anger, sadness, surprise, and joy, ...; the AFINN lexicon categorizes words using a score, with negative scores indicating a negative sentiment.

The function get_sentiments() allows us to get specific sentiment lexicons with the appropriate measures for each one.


```r
library(tidytext)
get_sentiments("bing")

#> # A tibble: 6,786 × 2
#>    word        sentiment
#>    <chr>       <chr>    
#>  1 2-faces     negative 
#>  2 abnormal    negative 
#>  3 abolish     negative 
#>  4 abominable  negative 
#>  5 abominably  negative 
#>  6 abominate   negative 
#>  7 abomination negative 
#>  8 abort       negative 
#>  9 aborted     negative 
#> 10 aborts      negative 
#> # … with 6,776 more rows

```











```r
count_time_machine <- tidy_time_machine %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
  
wordcloud(words = count_time_machine$word,
          freq = count_time_machine$n,
          random.order = FALSE,
          max.words = 100,
          colors = brewer.pal(8,"Dark2"))
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2: Can you create wordcloud using the package `wordcloud`?

Display the word frequencies of the clean data of the three novels by H.G. Wells that appear over 100 times.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output

```r
tidy_hgwells %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n > 100) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
    geom_col() +
    xlab(NULL) +
    coord_flip()
```

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.txt) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can also include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

Or you can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
